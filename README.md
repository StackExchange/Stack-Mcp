## 🚀 What is Stack Overflow MCP?

Stack Overflow MCP is a standardized "front door" for AI agents to discover and interact with Stack Overflow's trusted knowledge base.

It enables your AI to:

* **🔍 Search:** Search relevant technical questions and answers.
* **📖 Retrieve:** Retrieve full conversation threads, including accepted solutions and comments.
* **🧠 Ground:** Ground answers in community-verified data to reduce hallucinations.

All through natural language — just describe your technical problem and let it do the heavy lifting for you.
